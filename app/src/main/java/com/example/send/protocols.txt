communication over TCP and QR (protocol):
    generate QR with private IP if WiFi active {app_qr_id_key, receiver_ip, random_key_for_server_communication} else {app_qr_id_key, random_key_for_server_communication} -> communicate over server
    send req to receiver if WiFi active {app_id_key, send_req_key, sender_ip} else -> communicate over server
    receiver answer back to sender {receive_accepted_key}
    send data to receiver {app_id_key, send_data_key, data}
    send confirmation {app_id_key, receive_status_received}
